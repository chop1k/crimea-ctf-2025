# 8Bit (Steganography)

*Challenge*: Extract the flag from multiple similar-looking images.

## Solution
We open first image in StegSolve. Then open "Analyze > File format".

![1](../Images/8bit_1.png)

There we will get the first flag.

![2](../Images/8bit_2.png)

We do the same with second image.

![3](../Images/8bit_3.png)

Now we have 2 chunks of flag that we need to merge and submit.

## The flag
```text
crimea_ctf{HunTinG_PRive$C_CLeArwEb_P0rta1}
```
